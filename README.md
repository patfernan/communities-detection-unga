# Communities Detection using Graph Embedding techniques
 
This study employs graph embedding techniques, specifically Node2Vec and Graph Autoencoders (GAEs), to analyze voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly(UNGA). The study aims to uncover communities and dynamics in international relations using UNGA voting records. Traditional methods fall short in capturing the complexity of these relations, hence the application of advanced graph embedding methods. This study starts by highlighting the complexities of UNGA voting data and the need for advanced analysis. The methodology section is a detailed exploration of the process used for community detection, incorporating aspects such as data analysis, voting similarity, and the use of Node2Vec and GAE algorithms. Results are then presented, showcasing the effectiveness of the model in identifying distinct voting blocs and illustrating these findings through visualizations. Finally, the paper concludes with reflections on the insights gained and potential avenues for future research.
